<h1>Summary</h1>

<ul><li>After we successfully install Python we open our Jupyter Notebook by navigating to our command prompt and typing jupyter notebook.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>Markdown language allows us to type in HTML commands in our cells.  This provides us with a way to easily annotate our workbooks.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
The pound sign (#) allows us to comment our work. It's a way to document our work inside a code cell. 
When we use the as keyword we are creating an alias. It's just a way to reference our library more simply.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>  pandas Series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data..</li> </ul>
<ul><li>Once we've declared and place data in our variable we can view the first X number of rows using variable.head(). </li></ul>

<ul><li>A function takes parameters and returns a value.  A "method" is a specific type of function: it must be part of a "class", so has access to the class' member variables.  A function is usually discrete and all variables must be passed in.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Recall that methods end with parenthesis. So, head() is a method. 
Keep in mind that in a Series and most other objects in Python the 0 counts. So, inside most data sets the 0 will actually map to 1. </li> </ul>
<ul><li>
Once you understand the code go back and try to document each cell. </li></ul>
